Automated Environmental Wellness System

Our system integrates sensors to create an intelligent living environment. It detects gas emissions, LP gas leaks, and temperature/humidity fluctuations, controlling exhaust fans to maintain safety and comfort. Fire risks are mitigated with a fire sensor and an automated alarm system. Light intensity sensors optimize natural light, while custom rain sensors adjust windows for natural ventilation.

We designed a communication system that alerts the owner about fire risks and gas leaks via automated calls. Additionally, machine learning models identify gas types and assess fire risk probabilities based on sensor data during gas leakages.
